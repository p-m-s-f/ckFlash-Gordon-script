A Python script that uses forced browsing to download the current week's Flash Gordon strips from the Comics Kingdom website.

This script is most useful on Mondays, when the rest of the week's strips have not yet been publically released. The script becomes less and less useful as the week goes on, until Saturdays, when it has no use at all.

I've  uploaded [a video to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sBJFoyGJqs) which explains how I discovered this exploit, and how I automated it in the script.
